### ReactiveOps Coding Challenge

Using any language you prefer, write code that brings up an EC2 instance running the default page of a web application after running one line on the command line.

The one liner can (and likely will) call a longer shell script, or other configuration management code. AWS credentials for a dedicated region will be provided for you separately. By web application, feel free to choose among Django, Rails, Symfony, etc., but not the default Nginx or Apache setup.

If needed, you can manually create pre-requisites such as ssh key pairs and the like. The idea is that before you hit enter, there are no compute instances running and after, you supply an IP address, and at that address is a working web application. You're free to respond with a link to a git repo, or via email attachment.

Please don't take more than 3 hours, and questions and clarifications are entirely welcome.

Your credentials are attached as well, including the assigned region.
